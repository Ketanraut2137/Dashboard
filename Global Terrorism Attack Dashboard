### Global Terrorism Attack Dashboard 
🌟 Excited to share the completion of a project during my internship at InternCareer! 🚀
I had the fantastic opportunity to delve into the realm of global terrorism analysis by creating a comprehensive dashboard on Power BI. This involved an in-depth analysis covering various critical aspects:
📊 Total Number of Attacks: Analyzing trends and patterns over time to understand the frequency and nature of these incidents.
💪 Success Rate: Delving into the successful execution of these attacks, offering insights into their impact.
☠️ Total Deaths in Attacks: Understanding the human cost and its implications.
🔫 Weapons Used: Identifying the types of weapons deployed, crucial for understanding the methods employed.
🌍 Attacks by Regions: Exploring geographical variations and hotspots of terrorist activities.
📅 Attacks by Year: Analyzing trends and shifts in incidences across different years.
I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this crucial analysis and keen on leveraging these skills in future endeavors. Stay tuned for more insights and explorations into data analytics and its impact! 📈💡
